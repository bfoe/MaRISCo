<h1>MaRISCo_Lite</h1>
&emsp; This version has a considerably smaller footprint, to provide small standalone distributables.<br>
&emsp; However it does not read NIFTI segmentation results, but only the included RGB TIFF image,<br>
&emsp; in compensation it does not depend on Numpy/NiBabel modules any more.<br>
<br></p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2><p>
